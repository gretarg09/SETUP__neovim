# Neovim setup

My personal Neovim setup written in lua.


TODO:
- add folding: I can use this article to set it up https://alpha2phi.medium.com/neovim-for-beginners-code-folding-7574925412ea
- add lsp support for terraform.
- look into toolings to see the file tree. I want to quickly be able to see how a file is setup.
- setup my nodes in github and write it locally using markdown viewer. See https://jdhao.github.io/2019/01/15/markdown_edit_preview_nvim/

LEARNINGS:
- I need to take a lua course on udemy to understand the language better.
